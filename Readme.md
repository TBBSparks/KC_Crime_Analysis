# Kansas City Crime Data Analysis by Zip Code
Using crime data from the sources listed below, we wanted to show the crime rates broken down by zip code.  We previously went through the ETL (Extract; Transform; Load) process with our data we wished to use.  However, our dataset was rather large, so we decided to cover only data from 2015-2020 instead of all the data we had previously scrubbed. This allowed us to work without limitations within Github on this project.
